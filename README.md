# Orakai: The decentralised AI-Oracle for web3. Ask. Verify. Trust.

![banner](packages/assets/github.png)

## What is Orakai?
Orakai is a revolutionary decentralized AI oracle network that bridges the gap between smart contracts and artificial intelligence. By combining cutting-edge technologies like OpenRouter.ai for LLM processing, Storacha for decentralized storage, Randamu for verifiable randomness, and the Checker Subnet for governance, Orakai creates a trustless, secure, and efficient pipeline for AI-powered data streams in Web3 applications.

## Architecture

![Architecture](packages/assets/architecture.png)

### End to End flow

1. **User creates a query** through the frontend.
2. The **backend** stores query metadata and emits a job for workers.
3. The **smart contract** uses **Randamu** to randomly select eligible workers.
4. Selected **workers** independently run the query against OpenRouter LLMs and submit signed results.
5. Responses are uploaded to **Storacha/Filecoin** for transparency.
6. The **aggregator** waits for a quorum and submits the final agreed result.
7. The **smart contract emits** the response event.
8. The **consumer smart contract** reads and uses the result.

### Core Components

1. **Smart Contract Layer**
   - EVM-compatible contracts for query requests and responses
   - Randamu integration for verifiable randomness
   - Secure callback mechanisms for consumer contracts

2. **Backend Services**
   - User management and project creation
   - Query metadata storage and retrieval
   - Worker registration and management

3. **Aggregator Network**
   - Response validation and quorum establishment
   - Worker reputation management
   - Result finalization and submission

4. **Worker Network**
   - OpenRouter.ai integration for LLM processing
   - Storacha for decentralized data storage
   - Signature verification and response submission

5. **Checker Subnet**
   - Decentralized governance
   - Worker verification and reputation scoring
   - Penalty enforcement and rewards distribution

### Technology Stack
- **OpenRouter.ai**: Gateway for LLM processing and AI inference
- **Storacha**: Decentralized storage solution for response data
- **Randamu**: On-chain randomness for quorum selection and load balancing
- **Checker Network**: Decentralized governance and reputation system

## Potential Growth
- **Multi-Aggregator Network**: Enhanced decentralization through aggregator DAO
- **zkML Integration**: Zero-knowledge proofs for LLM inference verification
- **Token Economy**: Native token for staking, slashing, and payments
- **Query NFTs**: Decentralized query registry through NFT ownership
- **Cross-Chain Expansion**: Support for multiple blockchain networks
- **Advanced AI Models**: Integration with cutting-edge AI technologies
